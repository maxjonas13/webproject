		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>This site was created By Jonas Van der Sande & Joren Van hocht as a school project for the
			course Web Projects. <br>
			We had to create a project that was socialy meaningfull. Out of this came BeeHive.<br> 
			BeeHive is created for people to help each other<br>
			Everybody has something he just can't do for himself, or just can't pay for.<br>
			That's where Beehive comes in to view. It can be a medium to meet people, make friends<br>
			and help each other to fix things for someone else and get help in return.<br><br>

			Beehive is not liable for any unforseen damage that could be done by one of our members.</p>

				Hi, I'm Jonas. One of the creators of BeeHive. I'm a student MT at the Karel de Grote College in Antwerp.
				I have a passion for art, graphic design, music, webdesign, imagination, technology and everything around those things.
				So MT is the perfect place to follow my dreams. 
				Also I'm always looking for stuff that will blow my mind away. So I can use it as inspiration for one of my own projects.
